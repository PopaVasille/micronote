🎉 **Congratulations! Your account has been successfully connected!** 🎉

Welcome to MicroNote, your personal assistant that turns ideas into actions.

I'm here to help you never lose an idea again. Just send me a message, and I'll process and organize it for you.

**Here are a few examples you can try right now:**

✍️ **A simple note:**
`the marketing conference was very interesting`

✅ **A to-do task:**
`finish the report for Q3`

⏰ **A reminder:**
`remind me to water the flowers tomorrow at 9:00 AM`

🛒 **A shopping list:**
`buy milk, bread, eggs, and butter`

🚀 **My Superpower (Multiple Actions):**
`prepare the presentation for Monday and remind me to book a table at the restaurant for 7:00 PM`
_(I will create a task AND a reminder from a single message!)_

---

PS: You can always view and manage all your notes in the web interface on your dashboard.

Happy noting! 🧠
